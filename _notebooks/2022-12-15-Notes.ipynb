    "Iteration refers to the repetition of a process, and there are two types: indefinite and definite. In a definite iteration, it is clear how many times the loop will run, while in an indefinite iteration, the number of times the loop will run is not specified. For loops and while loops are examples of iteration. An object is considered iterable if it can be used in an iteration, and the built-in function 'iter()' returns an iterator for an object. Some common examples of iterable objects include strings, lists, dictionaries, sets, and tuples. The break statement can be used to stop a loop prematurely."
