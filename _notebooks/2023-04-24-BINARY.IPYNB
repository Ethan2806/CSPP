    "### DAT-1.A: Representing Data with Bits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Bit is short for binary digit, and represents a value of either 0 or 1.\n",
    "    - A byte is 8 bits.\n",
    "* Sequences of bits are used to represent different things.\n",
    "    - Representing data with sequences of bits is called binary encoding.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",
    "1. How many bits are in 3 bytes?24\n",
    "\n",
    "2. What digital information can be represented by bits?  Any information that can be represented using a binary system, such as numbers, letters, symbols, or even images and audio.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Are bits an analog or digital form of storing data? What is the difference between the two?  The difference between the two is that analog data is more susceptible to noise and distortion, while digital data can be easily transmitted, copied, and manipulated without losing quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Examples\n",
    "* Boolean variables (true or false) are the easiest way to visualize binary.\n",
    "    - 0 = False\n",
    "    - 1 = True\n"

    "#### Basic Information\n",
    "* Integers are represented by a fixed number of bits, this limits the range of integer values. This limitation can result in overflow or other errors.\n",
    "* Other programming languages allow for abstraction only limited by the computers memory.\n",
    "* Fixed number of bits are used to represent real numbers/limits\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Practice Questions:\n",

    "\n",
    "2. One programing language can only use 16 bits to represent non-negative numbers, while a second language uses 56 bits to represent numbers. How many times as many unique numbers can be represented by the second language?  1.099 x 10^12\n",
