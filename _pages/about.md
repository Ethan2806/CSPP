# My Goals in APCSP
I took this class because I plan on majoring in computer science in college. Ever since I was a little kid I was into computers and video games. I realized that I was more advanced than most people in computers and how to navigate. I want to learn about coding and python coding so I can take these skills further into college classes and my major.

# My background life
My name is Ethan Truong and I am 16 years old born on July 28th, 2006. I live at home with my mom, dad, and my brother. My brother is a freshman here at this school. I grew up in the area of Linda Vista with my grandparents and eventually moved out to 4s Ranch. I love to play basketball and video games on my freetime. Video games I play include valorant and warzone. Thanks for reading!
