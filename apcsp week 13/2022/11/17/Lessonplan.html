<p>-Learning how to convey a selection-based method using visual representations such as flowcharts and pseudocode rather than a programming language</p>

<p>-Depending on whether a condition is true or false, selection dictates which steps of an algorithm are carried out.</p>

<p>-A finite set of instructions known as an algorithm is used to complete a particular task.
includes combinations of iteration, sequencing, and selection.</p>

<p>-Using selection, we can decide amongst various options based on the outcome of a choice or condition.</p>

<p>-By executing various statements depending on the result of a Boolean expression, conditional statements, commonly referred to as “if-statements,” alter the sequential flow of control.</p>

<p>-You may format them as if or if else blocks.</p>

<p>-Any statement in the block of statements is completed if the condition is true.</p>

<p>-IF IS merely one specific consequence, IF ELSE, two outcomes.
After receiving user input, an IF statement will utilize that information to determine whether to put a Boolean expression in parenthesis or a block.</p>

<p>-Discover how to interpret the output of conditional statements.</p>

<p>-If blocks or IF ELSE blocks can be used to change the execution flow of conditional statements in our program, giving us the option to choose between two possible results.</p>

<p>-Only when the IF condition is false does ELSE run.</p>

<p>-The use of IF statements enables us to take specific action depending on whether a condition is true or false.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
<mark>PearDeck</mark> 3.5-3.7
-The plan is that me and Derek are going to present our section of the peardeck.  We will explain everything that you need to know from our <mark>3.6 videos</mark>, we will switch off between the slides that we create.  We plan on doing a reward for the people who get the questions right with something like candy.  Our lesson for our section will last for nearly 10 minutes and a scenario we could do is ask a question and see how they would code it on a vscode situation.</li>
