<h3 id="question-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 1</h3>
<p>Come up with three of your own Beneficial and corresponding Harmful Effects of Computing:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Enhanced commmunication and access to information -&gt; data security and privacy concerns</li>
  <li>Increased efficiency and productivity while doing certain tasks -&gt; dependence on technology and loss of tradictional skills</li>
  <li>Increased convenience and improved quality of life through technology -&gt; widening digital divide and socioeconomic inequality</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-2">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-2" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 2</h3>
<p>Talk about dopamine issues above. Real? Parent conspiracy? Anything that is impacting your personal study and success in High School?</p>
<ul>
  <li>I think dopamine issues above are real. Social media and games are designed to be addicting so they can attract people and keep those people interested. Personally, there have been many times where I feel distracted by social medias such as Instagram and Tiktok and I find it hard to focus on my studies.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-1-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-1-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 1</h3>
<p>How does someone empower themself in a digital world?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Someone can empower themself in a digital world by engaging with the digital world. For example, they can participate in online communities and social media, stay informed about digital trends, updates in technology, etc, and they can learn digital skills such as coding, digital marketing, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-2-1">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-2-1" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 2</h3>
<p>How does someone that is empowered help someone that is not empowered? Describe something you could do at Del Norte HS.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Someone empowered could help someone that is not empowered by informing them about certain information about the digital world. For example, someone might wnat to learn more about digital skills but might not know how. I could help teach them some or inform them about certain clubs and classes they could partake in, such as coding clubs, AP CSP/CSA, etc.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="question-3">
<a class="anchor" href="#question-3" aria-hidden="true"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Question 3</h3>
<p>Is paper or red tape blocking digital empowerment? Are there such barriers at Del Norte? Elsewhere?</p>
<ul>
  <li>Digital empowerment is blocked at different levels in different areas of the world or community, depending on how much that certain place as access to computers, internet, technology, etc. At Del Norte, I think the school does a good job at overcoming some of the barriers of blocked digital empowerment by providing chromebooks. However, there are some barriers that block digital empowerment for those who don’t have as much access to technology such as phones.</li>
</ul>
