# Question 3
- I got question 3 wrong I selected option A (Lossless compression of video files will generally save more space than lossy compression of video files.)
- The correct option was C (Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does.)
- The answer is B because lossless compression does not affect file space from video files
