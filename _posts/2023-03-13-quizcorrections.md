# Question 3
- I got question 3 wrong I selected option A (Lossless compression of video files will generally save more space than lossy compression of video files.)
- The correct option was C (Lossy compression of an image file generally provides a greater reduction in transmission time than lossless compression does.)
- The answer is B because lossless compression does not affect file space from video files

- I chose option B, which was 6.  The correct answer was option C because Binary 0022 = 2^1 + 2^0.

# Question 4, Using Programs with Data Quiz

- I chose options B and C, and the correct options were B and D.
- Answer D is correct because sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.
