# My Favorite Vacation Spot

My favorite vacation was when I went to Cancun, Mexico.  In Cancun, I did have one of the scariest experiences of my life when I fell off a jetski in the middle of the beach because there was a huge wave.  Besides that, everything else was fun.  The beach was very fun with huge waves.  The one downside to Cancun is that the air is very humid.  Other than that, we did things like parasailing, jet skiing, and swimming and it was super fun.
