# About me

## My Goals in APCSP

I took this class because I plan on majoring in computer science in college.  Ever since I was a little kid I was into computers and video games.  I realized that I was more advanced than most people in computers and how to navigate.  I want to learn about coding and python coding so I can take these skills further into college classes and my major.

## My background life

My name is Ethan Truong and I am 16 years old born on July 28th, 2006.  I live at home with my mom, dad, and my brother.  My brother is a freshman here at this school.  I grew up in the area of Linda Vista with my grandparents and eventually moved out to 4s Ranch.  I love to play basketball and video games on my freetime.  Video games I play include valorant and warzone.  Thanks for reading!
