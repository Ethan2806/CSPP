# Reflection 

# Skills obtained
- When I joined this course during the autumn, I had absolutely no prior experience in coding. Reflecting on my journey so far, I am amazed at how I managed to progress. Initially, I was completely clueless about where to begin, but I can confidently say that my trimester projects have been improving rapidly. Throughout the course, I have acquired various skills such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, web design, web deployment, backend development using Python and the Flask framework, leadership abilities, familiarity with scrum roles and processes, utilizing GitHub, and numerous others.

# Highs and Lows from This Year
- A high from this year is working in group projects it made a fun and more creative experience making me think outside of the box while also learning how to code new things

- Lows of the years were during the beginning of the first trimester I was behind because I joined the course late and was confused on a lot of the topics, but I figured a lot more out over time.

# Future Plans with Comp Sci & Education/Career
- In terms of future plans, I'm still not 100% sure if I want to major in computer science as my main major would be engineering, but I will obviously still keep practicing coding in the future as it is a useful skillset to have in life
