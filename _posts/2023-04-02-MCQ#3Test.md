# 1 
- Answer Chosen A
- Correct Answer B
- I chose 60 seconds but the answer was 80 seconds

# 6
- I chose Answer B
- Answer was A which is Each packet contains data to be transmitted, along with metadata containing information used for routing the data.

# 22
- I chose answer A
- Correct Answer was D which is Web Sites that are not visited frequently might no longer be accessible to users
- This is because the actions of the ISP will only affect how frequently visited pages are loaded into Web browsers. Pages not saved by the ISP are still accessed as they were before.

# 43
- Chose answer B 
- Correct answer was D which was making the code run faster because modularity and code reuse do not necessarily lead to faster-running code.

# 45
- I chose answer C
- Correct answer is option B because Correct the code segment draws the four circles shown in the figure. Each circle has a radius of 1 unit. The circles are centered at (2, 2), (2, 5), (5, 2), and (5, 5).

# 50
- I chose answer C
- Correct Answer was B because the algorithm I does not work correctly. In algorithm I, if two people are tied for the earliest birthday, they both sit down when they are eventually paired. Algorithm II works correctly. Because algorithm II allows both people to remain standing when there is a tie, a person with the earliest birthday is not eliminated. Algorithm II continues until all remaining people have the same birthday, which is the earliest birthday. Algorithm III does not work correctly. Algorithm III chooses the person(s) with the earliest day, disregarding the month. For example, algorithm III will incorrectly determine that a person born on February 1 has an earlier birthday than a person born on January 5.
