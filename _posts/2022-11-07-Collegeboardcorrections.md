A student is creating an application that allows customers to order food for delivery from a local restaurant. Which of the following is LEAST likely to be an input provided by a customer using the application?
Answer I picked : The credit card or payment information for the purchaser
Correct Answer : The cost of a food item currently available for order
The input that should least likely be provided is the cost of a food item currently available for the order because the price of the food is already listed on the delivery website and it shouldn't be an input because they already know the price
