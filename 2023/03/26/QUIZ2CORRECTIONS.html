<ul>
  <li>I chose answer B, correct Answer was A ((genre = “mystery”) AND ((1 ≤ num) AND (cost &lt; 10.00)))</li>
  <li>For a book to be counted, the value of genre must be “mystery” so that only mystery books are counted. The value of num must be greater than or equal to 1 so that only books that have at least one copy in stock are counted. The value of cost must be less than 10.00 so that only books that cost less than $10 are counted. All three conditions must be true, so the AND operator is used between them.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>I chose answers A and B</li>
  <li>Correct answers were B (Filter by photographer, then filter by year, then sort by year) and D (Sort by year, then filter by year, then filter by photographer)</li>
  <li>The answer was D instead of A because Sorting by year will sort the spreadsheet on column C from least to greatest. Filtering by year will remove any entries with unknown years. Filtering by photographer will remove any entries with unknown photographers. Since the order of the entries is not affected by the filters, the photograph with the lowest year value will be in the first row of the spreadsheet.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>I chose answer C, correct answer was B ((genre = “talk”) AND ((day = “Saturday”) OR (day = “Sunday”)))</li>
  <li>For a show to be counted, the value of genre must be “talk” and the value of day must be “Saturday” or “Sunday”.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
  <li>Chose answer B, correct answer was C(The transformed number is 8 times the value of the original number)</li>
  <li>This is because appending a 0 to the end of a binary number multiplies the number by 2. Therefore, appending three 0s to the end of a binary number multiples the number by 2 three times, which is the same as multiplying the number by 8.</li>
</ul>
